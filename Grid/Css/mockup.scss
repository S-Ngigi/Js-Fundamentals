      Here we define where we want our header column to start which is 1.

      We have to include the space in-between which is the second col.
      
      Lastly we have the far right space and specify that we want our
      header to start at 1 and end at 3.

      grid_column_start: 1;
      grid_column_end: 3;

      The short hand would be as follows.
        grid-column: 1 / 3; 
        grid-column: 1/ span 2;
      When we know the number of columns we are working with. 
      If we don't and we basically want to a column to span from left to right we can use;
        grid-column: 1 /-1;
